# BurgerApp

This CRUD application uses handlebars for templating and MySQL as a database to store various burgers.

Users may click on existing burgers on the left side of the app to reclassify them as "Devoured" on the right side. Users may also enter a name for a new burger that will be added to the "Fresh Burgers" side.
